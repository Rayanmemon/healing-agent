This issue is likely due to a configuration problem on the merchant's side, as the error message directly points to a webhook-related issue. The fact that stock levels are completely wrong and show 0 for products that the merchant has hundreds of also supports this conclusion, as it suggests a synchronization issue that could be caused by incorrect webhook configuration.",
